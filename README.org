* Hi there!

- My interests as a computer scientist and software developer lie mainly in the
  design and implementation of distributed systems. Nevertheless, I am also a
  passionate trainer.
- I code mostly in C++ and Python but I'm currently learning Go. Linux is my
  favorite operating system. Apart from that, I use the appropriate tools for
  the respective tasks.
